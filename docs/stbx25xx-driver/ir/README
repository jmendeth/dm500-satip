1. Introduction

This is the first release of the IR driver for Linux.  In this release, we support
the following IR devices:

    IR Remote Controllers
         Cinema 7 IR controller in Hitachi mode
    IR Keyboard / Mouse
	Acer infrared keyboard (Model No: WIL-14M, Revision No: 1.5)
        (Support of this device depends on the linux general keyboard driver and 
         generic busmouse driver interface)

2.Requirement
The driver is dependent on the stbkb driver and generic busmouse support, which 
should be compiled into the kernel. 

3.Installation
Modify Makefile and make changes according to your config.

  There are two compiling options can be defined in LOCAL_CFLAGS
    _IR_MOUSE_SUPPORT   Define this to enable Acer keyboard mouse pad support.
    _IR_RAWMODE_        Define this to enable capturing of all remote controll 
                        codes without filtering and translating 
                        **** This is not compatible with old applications ****



In the current directory, type these commands,
	
	$make
	$make install

On target platform :
     cd /dev
     mknod irmouse c 10 11
     ln -sf irmouse mouse
     mknod rawir c 100 0 
     

then driver can be loaded.

A example using the IR remote controller device can be found under the `test' subdir. 
It is also installed by `make install' to the target platform as `tstrawir'.
