This is a release version of Smart Card Linux device driver

1. General information of sci_drv
Major Number of sci_drv = 169
command "mknode /dev/sci0 c 169 0"
		"mknode /dev/sci1 c 169 1"
		will creat two file nodes

2. Files of sci_drv & its test file
2.1 sci_inf.c           The POSIX interface file of sci_drv
    sci_osd.c           The OS-dependent layer file of sci_drv
    sci_osd.h           The OS-dependent layer header file of sci_drv
    sci_osi.c           The OS-independent layer file of sci_drv
    sci_osi.h           The OS-independent layer header file of sci_drv
    sci_atom.c          The atom function file od sci_drv
    sci_atom.h          The atom function header file od sci_drv
    sci_local.h         The internel parameters and structure define file of sci_drv
2.2 test/mu_sci.c       The test menu file of scit
    test/mu_sci.h       The header file of test menu
    test/sci_prot.c     The protocol layer function of scit
    test/sci_prot.h     The public header file of protocol function
    test/sc.h           The private header file of protocal fucntion
2.3 ../include/sci/sci_inf.h        The POSIX interface header file of sci_drv
    ../include/sci/sci_global.h     The public header file of sci_drv

3. Usage of scit
3.1 "sc0" or "sc1" can select the card socket number. You have to do it first.
3.2 "rt" to reset and get ATR from the card
3.3 "sf" to send SELECT FILE 0x1005 command. If it response 0x90 0x00 means
	successful. If it response 0x6a 0x82 means FILE NOT FOUND.
3.4 "ur" to enter the ASCII what you want to write to the file 0x1005
3.5 "rr" to verify if the file update ssuccessful.
3.6 "sf" must be perform before "ur"/"rr"
3.7 NOTE: 
        The card reader MUST be connected to the borad properly. If the card
        reader is not present, the SCI regisiter can not reflect the status of
        if a card is present. This will result the device driver error.

4. Changes

Date        Bug Fixes                                   Affected sources
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/03/2001  Fixed error handling bug in sc_apdu() by    sci_prot.c
            adding check_incoming_data(). This fixed
            incorrect receive length occurring when
            card responds with a two byte error-code
            instead of the expected number of bytes.
            Fixed error handling problem in
            sc_t1_command().
            Improved data handling efficiency in
            sc_t0_command().

12/13/2001  Move init, uninit, reset, read, write and   sci_osd.c, sci_osi.c,
            irq handler to the OS-dependent layer.      sci_osi_local.c
            Merge sci_osi.c and sci_osi_local.c.

12/13/2001  EMV2000 support and made several changes    sci_atom.c, sci_osi.c,
            to improve PIO efficiency.                  sci_osd.c

12/13/2001  Changed SCI_MAX_F to 80000000.              sci_global.h

12/13/2001  Added EMV2000 defines, TX timeout define    sci_local.h
            and SCI_DRV_MODES defines.

01/11/2002  Add timeout to read/write function          sci_osd.c

07/04/2002  Add support for Vesta, Pallas and Vulcan    sci_atom.c
            in one driver file
